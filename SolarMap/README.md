This project is aimed at presenting the solar information provided to us by the "Duluth Shines!" and to add distributed aspects to the map in order to gain interest in solar.
* javascript map : `http://umd-cla-gis04.d.umn.edu/duluthshines/`
* Map on esri umn servers : `http://umn.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=53151b88aa124cf09d5a58c02bfe5a33`

Notes:
* Node server is a dependency
* The node server that it is currently using is lempo.d.umn.edu:2058 (if you would like to run the server on your lo)
* Password as a password o not reuse passwords.

Features we would like to be in app:
* A better system for showing people the most popular solar places in Duluth, possibly by adding a gradient layer or changing the color of each pin depending on how many “likes” it has.
* Achievements, or another method to encourage use of the app. (Gamify!)
* “GeoCaching” popular solar spots
* Comment threads on each of the buildings, organized by building IDs
* Utilize phone hardware to calculate solar in an area
